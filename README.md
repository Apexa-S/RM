Prototype Using AR/VR
i have created prototype Android application using Augmented reality and Vertual Reality for better tourism experience.
It would completely replace the conventional tour guide, and will work as your personal tour-guide which will guide you according to your location. Augment reality will enhance the tourism experience in an interesting way. The stories, beliefs, etc. can now be experienced instead of just hearing from guide. Also, this will reduce the fake guides spreading false information. It will also help in preserving our rich heritage and cultures and their old stories in form of videos, audios and images which could have get modified with time when passed from one person to another.

Hardware and Software used:
- Unity
- Android Studio
- Vuforia AR, Wikitude
- Google VR SDK and Cloud Computing
- WiggleVR
